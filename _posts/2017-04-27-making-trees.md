## A Six Pack and A Need For Trees

![hero](https://antimagicray.github.io/images/post-img/6packTree/hero.png)

Here's a quick to-do about making trees. This time around, I luckily had one of my favorite supplies on hand... Birminghams Cahaba American Blonde Ale...
Which made me think, what great bases the tops of the six pack would be...

I found a few twigs in the yard that had a good true look.  I also had some roots I saved from along time ago. I advise using roots, because their 'armatures' for the branches are more numerous and varied like a real tree's branches.  Also they are little more pliable, less likely to snap off when carting them around.  
I cut a small hole in the base and hotglued my twig in.
Next, I had some foliage bought from hobby lobby I used on four of the trees.  However, for our Malifaux game, I wanted to make a few with an 'autumnal' look.  So I cut up a kitchen sponge into irregular bits and haphazardly hotglued them to the tree to form the basic foliage.

Now, I know what you are thinking... those will be way to fragile for the world of tabletop gaming.  To mitigate some of this risk, I mounted magnets below. That way, I can put them on a piece of metal for easy transport. Or you could just put them in a bag and put tissue around them. Or better yet, you could just be very careful with them!

But look at the positive side. They are realistic... you really dont have to paint them.  Second, you save alot of time  and money by not having to tediously create armitures from wire or buy armitures from a hobby store.  

So anyway, I got a set of six trees with beer cap bases, ready for the flock and more foliage :

I also take my hot glue and draw some beads at the base, to make root structures coming out from the base of the tree for an added touch:

Here's a peachy-keen sponge foliaged tree in a more finished state :

In order to create an even more natural look, I brush on some watered down white glue and then flock them. I'm not worried about the color, it will be painted over. I just want the irregular, natural look of tree leaves:

Next are started adding my autumnal paint.  I just chose to do one a soft, red barn red and the seconde one orange.  I am also doing this quickly so I am just base coating the whole thing without regard for highlights and shadow, but feel free to highlight the leaves that will be hit by the sun or paint in shadowy areas under the leaves for more realism.

Next I prime the tree bases grey with vallejo grey primer.  Not sure if subsequent layers will stick or not without a primer, but I figure better safe than sorry, and prime anyway:

Next its time for one of my favorite parts.  Paint the base with white glue, then dip it in kitty litter or dirt.  I found  you can have a very natural dirt look, with stones and pebbles  of various sizes, by combining baking soda/play sand + high end kitty litter + cheap kitty litter.  The high end kitty litter is more uniform in pebble size, while the cheap dollar store kitty litter adds alot of variance, with stones of irregular sizes.  
Last, its advise to mix water and white glue and dab over the entire thing and let dry. This will help ensure the dirt sticks to the base, and doesnt come up and off when we start dry brushing details :

Next, when all that is dry, we can start applying our base coat of grey. You might need to water it down a bad to have it wash into the crevices, and it will help help the adherence of the dirt to the base.

All based up grey :

Next we need to add a wash to even tones, enhance shadows, increase naturalism etc.. I am using Army Painter Strong Tone, a brownish wash and I highly recommend using Citadel's Agrax Earth Shade for this as well.

Next, we start drybrushing layers. We really see our bases start to pop here.  I am using a pre-formulated light grey -- Citadel 'Administratum Grey' -- but you can just use your same  grey mixed with more white for a highlight instead.  I did this multiple times, added more white for more brighter spots, and am satisfied. Compare the drybrushed tree left, to the base coated tree, right. Purdy.

Final steps.  I didn't want the terrain to be totally desolate, so I added some glue and flock to mix in some grass.  I also have painted the tree roots, trying my best to color match the trunk.  Finally, add some bushes, clumps, rocks, etc  to give each tree a natural character.

Finished!

That's it. Thank you for reading. There is no more.  I hope you enjoy making the trees while swilling away good beer. -Stuart
