Finally got to experiment with my airbrush.  
Just a cheap $20 airbrush from Amazon hooked up to a el cheapo harbor freight shop compressor. 
<img src="/images/post-img/zenithGrid.jpg" alt="jekyll logo" " /> 
Worked great!  I primed a bunch of Zombicide Heroes and some XCOM board game miniatures with the 
3 color Zenithal airbrush technique.


1.  Prime the whole miniature black.
2.  At around a 45 degree angle, spray grey primer.  
3.  From the top "birds eye view" spray the white primer, directly downward.
